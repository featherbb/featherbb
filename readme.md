## About

FeatherBB is an open source forum application released under the GNU General Public
Licence. It is free to download and use and will remain so. FeatherBB is a fork of
FluxBB 1.5 designed to be simple and very lightweight, with modern features: MVC
architecture, PDO, OOP (soon) and a plugin system (soon). Maybe more? You're more
than welcome to join the development :-)

## Requirements

* A webserver
* PHP 5.3.0 or later
* A database such as MySQL 4.1.2 or later, PostgreSQL 7.0 or later, SQLite 2 or later

## Recommendations

* Make use of a PHP accelerator such as APC or XCache
* Make sure PHP has the zlib module installed to allow FluxBB to gzip output
